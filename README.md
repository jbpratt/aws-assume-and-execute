# assume and execute

Loop over a list of accounts, assuming a role into each account, then executing a command. The role must exist in the account and you must have permissions to assume into it.

```
# pass in account list by flag
python3 aae.py --role "Admin" --file=accounts.txt --command "./cleanup-default-vpcs.sh"

# or pipe in accounts
aws organizations list-accounts | jq '.Accounts | .Id' | python3 aae.py --role "Admin" --command "./cleanup-default-vpcs.sh"
```
